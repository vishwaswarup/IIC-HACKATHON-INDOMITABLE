# IIC-HACKATHON-INDOMITABLE
# Enhancing NISAR with AI

## Overview
This project integrates Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract actionable insights from NISAR satellite data and climate reports. The goal is to predict climate events like droughts or floods and provide supporting insights from external sources.

## Features
- Predict climate events using satellite data.
- Extract insights from textual climate reports.
- Combine ML and NLP for real-time, actionable insights.

## File Structure
- `main.py`: The main script for data simulation, model training, and insight generation.
- `data/`: Folder containing sample datasets and reports.
- `models/`: Folder to save trained models and vectorizers.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-link>
   cd nisar-ai-project
2. Install dependencies:
